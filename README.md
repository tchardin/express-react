# express-react

This is the most simple Boilerplate in the world for starting projects with React on the front end with Express server and server render.

## Getting Started

Before starting a React project just make sure you actually need all that fire power. If not maybe just use Vue?

### Installing

Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Running the app

Compile with webpack running the script with the following command

```
npm run dev
```
Start the server

```
npm start
```

## Deployment

Run production build of React with webpack command

```
webpack -p
```

Create Heroku staging with Heroku command line (optional)

```
heroku create --remote staging
```

Push Heroku staging

```
git push staging master
```

Create Heroku production

```
heroku create --remote production
```

Push Heroku production

```
git push production master
```
